    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>Call me Aragão. I've been programming for a short time, but I'm loving it. I'm currently studying Javascript, but I want to study many other languages and to learn to do many other things.</p>
    <p>I also love to get to know new people. I want to build many projects with others, and to help and be helped. Inclusive, I'm studying other languages just to improve communication.</p>
    <p>Maybe we'll find ourselves coding something together? Who knows.</p>
